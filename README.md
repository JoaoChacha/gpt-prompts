# GPT Projects

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to document all my experiments regarding `chatGPT`, currently the free version. At this point, I am still trying to improve my prompt engineering skills.

## Projects

- Dealership car management software.
  - TODO - Brief description of the application.

## TODOs

All my knowledge is youtube-driven. This means that I have no certification or something similar and everything is based on self learn. So, here's the list of TODOs that I want to move forward with in the next days:

- GPT prompt engineering course
- Learn AI insights

All my knowledge is superficial. I will try to improve on every single aspect of this subject.
