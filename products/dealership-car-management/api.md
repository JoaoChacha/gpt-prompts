API

Now I will help you understand our API. Our API is tRPC based always using typescript. We use the prisma connector to access database and change data. We always use the standard folder structure from create-t3-app to create new APIs and to change the ones that already exist.

API IMPROVEMENTS
1. What else do you need to know about our API so that you can have more context on what you are doing?
2. Did you understand where you should create or change the API when I ask you to?

TASKS
Your job will be to create and change APIs according to our app needs. For that I will give you some tasks:

1. create a crud api for the dealership model we created on our database. It should be possible to create, delete and change dealerships according to the client needs. Make sure you create the necessary unit tests for each api.

2. create a crud api for the car model we created on our database. It should be possible to create, delete and change dealerships according to the client needs. Make sure you create the necessary unit tests for each api.

Before continuing I will ask you for some feedback on these tasks.

TASKS IMPROVEMENTS
1. What additional feedback should I give you so that you can perform these API related tasks successfuly?

2. Can you please explain to me what should you on these API related tasks?
