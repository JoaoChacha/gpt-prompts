Database

Using prisma, I need you to create various models which will complete our database. By using the prisma configuration template that create-t3-app already has, please add the following models and their specific attributes according to your needs:
- car model. In this car model should be possible to check which user created the car. Also every car must be related to a dealership only.
- dealership

Each user also must be related to a single dealership. But, before doing what I said, I need you to describe what I said but in tasks. Ok?

TASKS

I will give you some tasks reggarding our database:

1. Using the given prisma configuration file by create-t3-app, please create a dealership model. This model must have the following properties: created at, id, name, and other properties that you might suggest.

2. Increment on that prisma config file by adding the car model I talked about. Each car must be related to one user and to one dealership. This means that one dealership can have multiple cars. Also, one user can be related to multiple cars.

3. Assign the corect data types to each of the attributes of our models.

Before you start doing them, I will ask you for some feedback.


DATABASE IMPROVEMENTS

1. What additional feedback should I give you so that you can perform these database related tasks successfuly?
2. Can you please explain to me what should you on these database related tasks?
